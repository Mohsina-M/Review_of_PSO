# Review of PSO
The repository for my paper ***A Review of Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms***, as the final project of the course ***Professional English***, here post the code include SPSO, BBPSO, CLPSO etc.

### Contents Declaration 

* In `Data`, there's all the simulation result stored in servel `.mat` files.  
* Experiment results have been stored into file `Tabs`, where as the most tables in paper suggested.  
* The experiment result has been visualized into figures which been referenced in paper from folder `Figs`.  
* `MatlabCode` has all algorithms' code involved in my paper, includes `APSO`, `BBPSO`, `breed-PSO`, `CLPSO`, `LDIW-PSO` and `SPSO`. Test functions have also been putting here in `Funs` folder, include `Ackley`, `Alpine`, `Griewank`, `Rastrigin`, `Rosenbrock`, `Schwefel`, `Sphere`, `Sum of Different Power` 

### Others

* Involved algorithms' code could be seen at: [RuYunW/Review_of_PSO](https://github.com/RuYunW/Review_of_PSO)  
* I've also posted the introduction of SPSO(Standard Partical Swarm Optimization) on Zhihu as an article which could be seen at: [Matlab标准粒子群优化算法代码](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/57288027)
